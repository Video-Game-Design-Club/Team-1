Requirements:

- change to arbitrary size (just in case)
- take click events
- hold gameobjects
- interact with enemy ai & gameloop
- show with sprites

Implementation:

- Grid Manager object with flat collider
    - changes size depending on grid size
    - also handles API requests for moving/adding/removing objects
    - API requests to test for other things in the grid
    - Interface for grid object? Could also just use game object reference
